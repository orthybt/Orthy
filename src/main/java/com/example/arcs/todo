TODO file where i write down all the things i want to do in the future.
 -> Decipher your own code
    -> Start with ArcHandler and OrthyArc
    -> Currently i am tracing the execution flow of arcPoints

draw on paper how each object in orthy arc is connected with arc handler
    -> In the Controller class
        -> drawArc -> handleDrawArcButton -> DrawArcButtonHandler.handle()
            -> handle(MouseEvent event)
                -> check if the arc is initialized
                    -> if not
                        -> arcHandler.selectPoints()
                    -> if yes
                        -> createArc()
                        -> drawArc()
                        -> stop here and make the arc show its length if the
                           calibration is done, else just draw the arc.

arcHandler.selectPoints(event, drawingPane)
    -> The OrthyArc is initialized as a blank arc in the constructor of ArcHandler
    -> The first point is set in the first call of selectPoints()
        -> Direct call to OrthyArc.setStartPoint()
    -> The second point is set in the second call of selectPoints()
        -> Direct call to OrthyArc.setEndPoint()
    -> After each point is set, that point is drawn on the drawingPane
    -> After the second point is set, the arc is initialized with those two points
    -> point selection just adds points to the list of arcPoints

Make a point selector class that will select points. THe number of points is
irelevant. The point selector will just select points from an event and add the
to a tempList. And i will use this tempList to initialize the arc or any object
of my choosing. THe select Points method will be removed from the arc handler
as well as the draw point method

Lets sum it all up

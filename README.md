# Orthy
framework for the tools i use in my daily work
I am an orthodontist, a gamer(wanted to say former, but naaah there is still hope for me :) )
Thought myself coding a while ago, and i made some tools that are usefull for my daily work.
Lately i got myself into the world of aligner desing and this tools proved to be of enormous value.
It draws lines, measures distances on a 2D photo, its like a drawing pad, idk... its a work in progress
Feel free to contact me for whatever reason you need me

Love <3
